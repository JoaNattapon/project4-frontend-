## User Story
  Hello, there let's explain what happen in client side. First once user get into the landing page they will clearly see the the navigation bar up top
  and below the nav bar they will see an introduction page that explain about all critical disease definition and all other importance information 
  to help customer gain more knowledge about the disease and also health insurance package and protection, without any need to registration. After the customer 
  go through all of the information they can dicide either they want to leave a page or go into other link such as registration, all packages. So, After they finish
  registration they will be able to log in using their username and password and they just regist. After that they can go to look up on insurance packages to see
  what suit them the most. Finally, in case they still have question to ask for they can look down on the footer they will see the contact for Dhipaya for more detail.

## What I've learn 
  This is a final project the schedule is tight and something things can get messi easily even you plan out everything carefully. That is because I still have low 
  experience and am touching with this tool. However, that is the best thing that should heppen to all of us especially when we just start out to learn to programming
  we will better understand something when we really get our hand dirty and try to go through debuging process by yourself. And another that I've learned from this 
  project is that don't compare yourself to other everyone have difference learning speed just hold tight it will come definitely !. Last but not least, communication !
  this is another crucial point when you got stuck for too long just ask your instructor or your classmate right away noone expecting you to know all of these tool
  right after finish the lesson. Finally, thank you so much for reading this hope youguys doing well happy coding ! :)
